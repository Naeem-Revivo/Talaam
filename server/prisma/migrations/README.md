# Prisma Migrations

This folder contains database migration files generated by Prisma.

## Running Migrations

### Development
To create and apply a new migration:
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

This will:
1. Create a new migration file in this folder
2. Apply the migration to your database
3. Regenerate the Prisma Client

### Production
To apply existing migrations (without creating new ones):
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
```

## Migration Files

Migration files are automatically generated by Prisma and follow this structure:
```
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_migration_name/
  └── migration.sql
```

Each migration folder contains a `migration.sql` file with the SQL statements needed to update your database schema.

## Important Notes

- **Never edit migration files manually** - They are auto-generated
- **Always review migrations** before applying to production
- **Backup your database** before running migrations in production
- Migration files are version controlled and should be committed to your repository

## Initial Migration

To create the initial migration from your Prisma schema:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will create the first migration based on your `schema.prisma` file.
